#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int x = 30, y = 40;
    if(x == y)
        printf("x is equal to y\n");

    else if(x > y)
        printf("x is greater than y\n");

    else if(x < y)
        printf("x is less than y\n")
    return 0;    
 }   
The following statements are correct in the given program:

The program defines a function named main which is of type int.
The function main declares two integer variables x and y and initializes them with the values 30 and 40 respectively.
The program uses a series of if-else statements to compare the values of x and y and prints a message based on the comparison result.
Since x is less than y, the program will print the message "x is less than y" to the console.
The program ends by returning an integer value 0 to the operating system, indicating successful execution.
There is a syntax error in the program due to the missing semicolon after the printf statement in the last else-if condition. This error should be fixed by adding a semicolon at the end of the printf statement.
